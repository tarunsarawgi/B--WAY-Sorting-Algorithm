A sorting algorithm is a method for again organising a large number of items in a specific order either ascending or descending. The algorithm discovered here after the analysis of most sorting algorithms .

The main target of this algorithm is to sort the numbers in the ascending order and the descending order at a time along with the margin data that by what number is the other number bigger or smaller by the numbers individually . This algorithm will achieve this target in very less time.

This also a 2-loop algorithm , but no multiplication and division operations used , only addition , subtraction and counting operations used .

This algorithm creates a matrix of the operations performed on the list of numbers then accordingly the numbers are sorted .
